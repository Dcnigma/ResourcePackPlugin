# ResourcePackPlugin
Just a simple Minecraft plugin to load a resource packs.

My first Minecraft plugin!  So its not the best haha!

You can use these commands "/loadpack1" to "/loadpack5"

So you have 5 commands to load your resources packs.
You can use this command with a event or commandblock to load the resource pack at any time you like.
Set permisions for members or specials groups.

There is one more command:
"/resourcepackplugin reload" to reload the "plugin.yml" after you made some changes

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/Dcnigma/ResourcePackPlugin/blob/main/Screenshot/server_resource.png?raw=true" alt="ResourcePackPlugin"  width="600" height="340" />
</div>

You can change the plugin.yml to your liking:

Example:  
"  loadpack1:

"    description: Load Redbull Resource Pack!

"    usage: /loadpack1

"    permission: default

"    resource-pack-urls:

"      - "https://example.com"


At the moment you can't change the Usage Commands. 

The only thing you can change are the permission and resource-pack-urls, 

The Description is optional is not used at this moment



Cheers!
